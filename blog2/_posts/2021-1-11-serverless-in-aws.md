Working with software development can become a hassle when having to account for servers capacity, network traffic and different development environments. Moreover, capital expenses of acquiring and maintaing a server park is significant. A solution to these problems have been to use these servers as a service provided by a third part. 

Different levels of service are offered, depending on how much configurability, security and flexibility that are needed. The latest addition to these services are FaaS (Function as a service), which abstracts away all overhead configuration, leaving only the function calls to be configured. Serverless applications do not require you to provision, scale and manage any servers. 

AWS offers FaaS (function as a service) on different services, among these are Lambda, DynamoDB, Gateway API and S3. This post will utilize these four services to set up a data base and a static web site which can be used as a front end to collect data from the the data base. 

The architecture can be seen above.

### Lambda function


The lambda function is to be triggered from a call to the gateway API. Handler will receive a key value for the database search and use it to make a query in the no sql database.

```
const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
var DocClient = new AWS.DynamoDB.DocumentClient();

var tableName = "DatabaseTable";

exports.handler = (event, context, callback) => {
    console.log(event.EmailID)

    var params = {
        TableName : tableName,
        Key:{
            "EmailID" : event.EmailID
        }
    }
    DocClient.get(params, function(err, data) {
      callback(err, data);  
    })
   
}
```
### Gateway API

Navigate to gateway API and create a REST API.

To enable the use of the gateway API on the static web site it is important to enable CORS. CORS is an acronym for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. This enables the use of JavaScript to make authenticated GET and PUT requests.

Create a new GET resource which will be connected to the lambda function created earlier, that is it will trigger the lambda function when a call to the API has been made.

Further one need to map the values from the API call.

### DynamoDB

The no sql data base can be created with CloudFormation in AWS. CloudFormation is a Infrastructure as Code (IaC) service in AWS which enables infrastructure setup in text format, most common is YAML and JSON format. 

```
Resources:
    ServerlessWebappDBTable:
        Type: AWS::DynamoDB::Table
        Properties:
          AttributeDefinitions:
            - AttributeName: EmailID
              AttributeType: S
          KeySchema:
            - AttributeName: EmailID
              KeyType: HASH
          ProvisionedThroughput:
            ReadCapacityUnits: 1
            WriteCapacityUnits: 1
          TableName: DatabaseTable

```


### Static web hosting


The static web site is written in HTML with the following function handling the API call. 
Upload the index.html file to a bucket in S3 and enable static website hosting with permissions described in bucket policy. 
```
        $(document).ready(function() {

            var customerViewModel = function() {
            var self = this;
            self.firstName = ko.observable("");
            self.lastName = ko.observable("");
            self.emailId = ko.observable("");
            self.searchKey = ko.observable("");

            self.getCustomerDetails = function () {              
                $.ajax({
                    url: 'generated-aws-address/Dev/getcustomerdetailsbyemail',
                    cache: false,
                    type: 'GET',                   
                    data: { "EmailID": self.searchKey() },
                    success: function (data) {              
                        self.firstName(data.Item.FirstName)
                        self.lastName(data.Item.LastName),
                        self.emailId(data.Item.EmailID)
                    }
                });
            }
        }

            var viewModel = new customerViewModel();
            ko.applyBindings(viewModel);
         });
```

### Bucket policy 

The following policy will allow anyone to access the specified resource. 

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Id": "",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::lundha-serverless-webapp/*"
        }
    ]
}
```
