*Trivial info:*

I am a graduate of the University of Calabria, in Italy, who has enjoyed working in many different fields since his M.Sc. in Environmental Engineering. I am now doing [my PhD at Newcastle University](https://research.ncl.ac.uk/water/people/phdstudents/francescocastellani/), in the United Kingdom, in Civil Engineering. I find joy in using Jupyter for both Python and R, and have always been fascinated by data. Being part of the [alumni](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154544111016546&set=pcb.312954742468214&type=3&theater) of the [New England Complex Systems Institute (NECSI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Complex_Systems_Institute) has given me the tools to put this fascination into practice. **This portfolio is meant to help me pursue a Data Science career by showcasing a few projects**. In doing this, I was inspired by [a Ted talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xsvGYIxJok) given by [Ben Wellington](https://www.ted.com/speakers/ben_wellington), who says that Data Science should really be about **storytelling**.


*Non-trivial info:*

I am a former academy basketball player, and I still play in my spare time. I appreciate coffee, and my passion as a kid was Geography. I wear hockey jerseys on Saturdays, and watch NHL games when Time Zones are friendly. I am a Winnipeg Jets fan, have fallen in love with Applewood Cheddar, and acknowledge British Columbia as the birthplace of Wolverine. I am totally in for a scone, especially if it comes with butter and strawberry jam. I love *Grumpy Old Men* (the 1993 movie with Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon), and think the World would be a better place if all communities had the same atmosphere as Wabasha, Minnesota. I like craft beer, and especially double IPAs. I buy Bill Bryson's books, but never make it to the end.


*For prospective employers:*

I will buy you a double IPA if you hire me.
