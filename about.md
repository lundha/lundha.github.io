*Trivial info:*

I am a graduate from the University of Calabria, in Italy, who has enjoyed working in many different fields since his M.Sc. in Environmental Engineering. I am now doing my PhD at Newcastle University, in the United Kingdom, in Civil Engineering and Geosciences. I find joy in using Jupyter for both Python and R, and have always been fascinated by data. This portfolio is meant to help me to pursue a Data Science career, showing some small projects. I was heavily influenced by [this Ted talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xsvGYIxJok) by [Ben Wellington](https://www.ted.com/speakers/ben_wellington), who says that Data Science should really be about **storytelling**.

*Non-trivial info:*

I am a former basketball player, a beer and coffee lover, and a wannabe geographer. I wear hockey jerseys on Saturdays, and watch NHL games when Time Zones are friendly. I am a Winnipeg Jets fan, I have fallen in love with Applewood Cheddar, and I acknowledge British Columbia as the birthplace of Wolverine. I love Grumpy Old Men, and think the World would be a better place if all cities were like Wabasha, Minnesota. I like craft beer, and especially double IPAs. I buy Bill Bryson's books, but never make it to the end.

*For prospective employers:*

In all honesty, I am the best candidate available. I will buy you a double IPA if you hire me.
