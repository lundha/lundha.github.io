### Reading is always good

This post is not my typical Data Science project, but rather an opportunity for reflection. All good reasons for you to continue reading!

A friend of mine working in the field of Risk Management pretty much said that he owes it to a specific book if his career led him where he is now. This book is [The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Swan:_The_Impact_of_the_Highly_Improbable), by the American-Lebanese statistician [Nassim Nicholas Taleb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb). It is frankly quite hard to categorize the book as it is to categorize the author, but suffice it to say that it is a thought-provoking journey into the concept of Black Swans - events with low probability of occurring and disproportionately large impacts.

### Civil Engineering Infrastructures belong in Extremistan

Dr. Taleb states that Black Swans are a daily feature of Extremistan, an idealized world where the impact of an event is vastly superior in magnitude to the probability of that event occurring. You drop your sandwich, it lands with the butter-side down, you slip on that, and it all escalates. I can recall quite a few events involving Infrastructures that happened in a less idealized world:
- [The I-35W Mississippi River Bridge collapse in Minneapolis (2007)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I-35W_Mississippi_River_bridge);
- [The King's Cross fire in London (1987)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Cross_fire);
- [The St. Francis Dam failure in Los Angeles County (1927)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Francis_Dam).
