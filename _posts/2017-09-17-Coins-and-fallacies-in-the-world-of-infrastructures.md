### Reading is always good

This post is not my typical Data Science project, but rather an opportunity for reflection. All good reasons for you to continue reading!

A friend of mine working in the field of Risk Management pretty much said that he owes it to a specific book if his career led him where he is now. This book is [The Black Swan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Swan:_The_Impact_of_the_Highly_Improbable), by the American-Lebanese statistician [Nassim Nicholas Taleb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb). It is frankly quite hard to categorize the book as it is to categorize the author, but suffice it to say that it is a thought-provoking journey into the concept of Black Swans - events with low probability of occurring and disproportionately large impacts.
