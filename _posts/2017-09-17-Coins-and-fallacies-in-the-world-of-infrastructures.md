### Reading is always good

This post is not my typical Data Science project, but rather an opportunity for reflection. All good reasons for you to continue reading!

A friend of mine working in the field of Risk Management pretty much said that he owes it to a specific book if his career led him where he is now. This book is [The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Swan:_The_Impact_of_the_Highly_Improbable), by the American-Lebanese statistician [Nassim Nicholas Taleb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb). It is frankly quite hard to categorize the book as it is to categorize the author, but suffice it to say that it is a thought-provoking journey into the concept of Black Swans - events with low probability of occurring and disproportionately large impacts.

### Civil Engineering Infrastructures belong in Extremistan

Dr. Taleb states that Black Swans are a daily feature of Extremistan, an idealized world where the impact of an event is vastly superior in magnitude to the probability of that event occurring. You drop your sandwich, it lands with the butter-side down, you slip on that, and it all escalates. I can recall quite a few events involving Infrastructures that happened in a less idealized world:
- [The I-35W Mississippi River Bridge collapse in Minneapolis (2007)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I-35W_Mississippi_River_bridge);
- [The King's Cross fire in London (1987)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Cross_fire);
- [The St. Francis Dam failure in Los Angeles County (1927)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Francis_Dam).

Now, either there is something disturbing about years ending in 7, or our Infrastructures are an easy prey, as the list goes on and on (the latest entry being the unfortunate Grenfell Tower fire). In each one of these examples, an apparently meaningless event escalated into dramatic consequences: the neglected corrosion discovered on the pillars of the Mississippi River Bridge, the match thrown onto the wooden escalators at King's Cross as a result of an ignored ban, and the cracks on the surface of the St. Francis Dam that William Mulholland himself dismissed. Drop, butter-side down, slip. Repeat.

### The quest for a wise decision-maker, or Tony vs Dr. John and the flipping of a coin

As per the book, the good Dr. Taleb has two friends: Tony and Dr. John. Tony is a self-made man and an accountant who rose to success by "reading the situation" and contextualizing. He has no formal education, but claims to be able to interpret the human species. Dr. John is an Electrical Engineer with a PhD, and it is his scientific and methodical mind that guides him through the day.

Tony and Dr. John meet one day. In front of them, Dr. Taleb is going to toss a coin 100 times. The penultimate toss gives heads, making it 99 times straight. At this point, Dr. Taleb asks his two friends to predict what the next outcome will be. Tony says that there is something "loaded", e.g. the system is rigged and it does not play out fairly; as such, he gives **tails** no more than a 1% probability. Dr. John, realizing that the flips are independent events, says and that it is going to be either **heads** or **tails**, and both have 50% chances.
