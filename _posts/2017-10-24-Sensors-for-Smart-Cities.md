#### Problem Statement: the Urban Heat Island Effect (UHI)

<img src="/images/Atlanta_thermal.jpg" width="380" height="280"> 


The image above was collected in May 1997 by NASA ([source](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=6026139)) 
to show the distribution of temperatures in downtown Atlanta. The majority of the white areas happen to be located on roofs, and 
a significant contribution is given by the streets (in red). This phenomenon, known as [Urban Heat Island effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_heat_island), is all but new, having first been observed in the early 19th Century. It indicates an increase in temperatures around the city core with respect to the rural areas surrounding it, and it is caused by the introduction of dark surfaces - [asphalt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asphalt), mainly - that absorb the incident solar radiation. This leads to an increase in temperature on the surface of dark objects, which in turn produces a spike in the thermal radiation they emit back into the air. 
Rooftops and roads are particularly good heat absorpters, due to the presence of [asphaltene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asphaltene).

A look into the typical values of [thermal conductivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_conductivity) quantifies the extent to which concrete and asphalt are serious contributors, their contribution being amplified by the dense spatial presence of roads and rooftops.

As pointed out by the [NASA Earth Observatory](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/UrbanRain/urbanrain2.php), the UHI effect triggers a climatic negative effect. Urban landscapes may experience temperatures between 3.5째C and 4.5째C higher than the surrounding landscapes, resulting in warmer and unstable layers of air that can hold more moisture. [Research has demonstrated that this increases the frequency of more extreme rainfall events in the summer](https://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/17/5439/2017/acp-17-5439-2017.pdf) in the Northern Hemisphere. As a result, the risk of floods may increase.

#### The Los Angeles solution

<img src="/images/LA.jpg" width="380" height="280"> 

The Mayor of Los Angeles has recently committed to painting some of the city streets in a light shade of grey (picture above, [Bureau of Street Services](https://bss.lacity.org)) in an attempt to cut the UHI effect. As reported by the [press](http://www.digitaljournal.com/news/environment/los-angeles-paining-streets-white-to-combat-urban-warming/article/502092), the ambition is to decrease urban temperatures by as much as 1.67째C over the next two decades. The plan is to use a specific coating that, in a pilot experiment, led to a decrease in road surface temperature of 4.5째C, which apparently could offset the projected increase highlighted by NASA.
