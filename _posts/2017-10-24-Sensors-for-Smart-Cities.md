#### The Urban Heat Island Effect

The image above was collected in May 1997 by NASA ([source](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=6026139)) 
to show the distribution of temperatures in downtown Atlanta. The majority of the white areas happen to be located on roofs, and 
a significant contribution is given by the streets (in red). This phenomenon, known as [Urban Heat Island effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_heat_island), surprisingly has a long history, dating back to the early 19th Century. It indicates an increase in temperatures around the city core with respect to the rural areas surrounding it, and it is caused by the introduction of dark surfaces - [asphalt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asphalt), mainly - that absorb the incident heat. This leads to an increase in temperature on the surface of dark objects, that in turn produces a spike in the thermal radiation emitted by the targeted objects.
