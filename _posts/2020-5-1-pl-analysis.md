## Exploratory data analysis of Premier League season 19/20

#### Using Pythons pandas to explore o/u 2.5 goals statistics

Reading the csv data and creating a pandas data frame to store it in

{% highlight python3 %}


pl_stats19_20 = pd.read_csv (r'/Users/Lund/pl-analysis/data/pl1920.txt')
df = pd.DataFrame(pl_stats19_20)

{% endhighlight %}

Starting by selecting the columns which we are going to use for our data analysis.
This will be to start with:

| P>2.5         | Pinnacle over 2.5 goals       |
| P<2.5         | Pinnacle under 2.5 goals      |

| Avg>2.5       | Market average over 2.5 goals |
| Avg<2.5       | Market average under 2.5 goals|


Using numpy to select the desired columns to work with, where the 

{% highlight python3 %}
df = df.iloc[:, np.r_[3:11, 12:24, 48:56]]
{% endhighlight %}

#### What to look for

Questions is

- How many % of matches ended up over 2.5 goals
- How many did the odds correspond to the statistics(i.e odds of 2.00 give 0.5 probability)


{% highlight python3 %}
df['TG'] = df['FTHG'] + df['FTAG']
df['TG>2.5'] = np.where(df['TG']>2.5, 1, 0
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight python3 %}
print(df['TG>2.5'].value_counts(normalize=True))
{% endhighlight %}

Gave the percentages 


- Over 2.5 = 52.43%
- Under 2.5 = 47.57%

Further, the odds of over 2.5 goals was over 2 

{% highlight python3 %}
print(df['Odds>=2'].value_counts(normalize=True))
{% endhighlight %}

Gave the percentages


- Over or equal 2 = 22.92%
- Under 2 = 77.08%
