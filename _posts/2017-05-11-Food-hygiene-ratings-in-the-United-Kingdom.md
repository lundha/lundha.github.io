### Intro

Eating safe food is not always a given. While sitting at the table of a restaurant, I have seen a fair number of people being utterly disgusted by the sight of a dirty fork, a greased knife, or a glass (unexpectedly) embellished by lipstick stains. [Bill Bryson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Bryson) would be glad to know that sometimes all of these had devilishly gathered *at the same table*. The reaction is always the same, because in one way or another, we are all concerned with hygiene when we visit a restaurant, a hotel, a pub, or any other place (especially if we have to pay).

In the United Kingdom, as well as in most Countries, this matter is taken seriously by the Government. In 2001, following the proposal of a [detailed report](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/265718/fsa.pdf), the [Food Standards Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_Standards_Agency) was formed, the purpose being to screen all businesses that serve food. The idea was to make sure they complied with a set of hygiene standards, so that food always remained safe to eat.

In Scotland, food hygiene standards are overseen by [Food Standards Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_Standards_Scotland), while in the rest of the United Kingdom they are enforced by the [Food Standards Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_Standards_Agency).

As of May 2017, there are 47,477 businesses to be screened in Scotland, and 469,897 in the rest of the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland. This is a huge cohort, and the task is accomplished using *two different* schemes: the **Food Hygiene Information Scheme (FHIS)** in Scotland and the **Food Hygiene Rating Scheme (FHRS)** in the rest of the United Kingdom. The first uses *categorical* descriptors that are directly assigned to each business (Table 1), while the second adopts a *points scheme* that assigns high scores to poor hygiene conditions (Table 2).

### Parsing xml files from the Food Standards Agency website

To figure out which areas of the UK host the dirtiest businesses food-wise, it is necessary to parse the [Food Standards Agency website](http://ratings.food.gov.uk/open-data/), where data are publicly available to download. These come in the form of [xml](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) files that are grouped by region and local authority (Scotland is included). Given the different rating system in place for Scotland, a separate analysis is required, and the results will not be adjusted to those of the rest of the UK.

This section is about:
  1. Scraping the [Food Standards Agency html page](http://ratings.food.gov.uk/open-data/) to extract the file names to be downloaded;
  2. For each region on the html page, downloading a zip folder containing only the relevant xml files.

Python makes it easy to do both. We can scrap websites with the [BeautifulSoup](http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/beautifulsoup/beautifulsoup-4-python) package. All we need to do is define an url, and we can use [urllib2](https://docs.python.org/2/howto/urllib2.html) for this. Then, the download can be performed using a list of file names produced parsing the html page, as BeautifulSoup needs to know which files we need. In the end, a zip folder will be created for each region on the html page, with each folder containing only the relevant xml files.

    {% highlight python %}
    from __future__ import division
    import urllib2
    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
    import os 
    import zipfile
    
    #Set project folder
    myfolder = r'C:\Users\MyName\MyFolder' #Change as appropriate
    os.chdir(myfolder) #Get inside the project folder

    #Set the url of a website
    url = 'http://ratings.food.gov.uk/open-data/'
    f = urllib2.urlopen(url)
    mainpage = f.read()
    
    #Get the list of file names to download
    soup = BeautifulSoup(mainpage, 'html.parser')
    tablewrapper = soup.find(id='openDataStatic')
    regions = []
    filenames = {} #Dictionary with {Region:[list of file names]}
    with open('Regions_and_files.csv', 'w') as f:
        f.write("Region,City,File,Businesses"+'\n')
        for h2 in soup.find_all('h2')[6:]:
            temp = [] #Stores the links for each region
            region = h2.text.strip() #Get the text of each h2 without the white spaces
            regions.append(str(region))
            table = h2.next_sibling.next_sibling
            for tr in table.find_all('tr')[1:]: # Skip headers
                tds = tr.find_all('td')
                if len(tds)==0:
                    continue
                else:
                    a = tr.find_all('a')
                    link = str(a)[10:67]
                    span = tr.find_all('span')
                    businesses = int(str(span[3].text).replace(',', '')) #Number of businesses for each local authority
                    if "cy" not in link:   #Avoiding files in Welsh
                        temp.append(link)
                        f.write("%s,%s,%s,%s" % \
                                      (region,str(tds[0].text)[1:-1], link, businesses)+'\n')
            filenames[region] = temp
            
    #Parsing the html page and saving the xml files to the appropriate folder based on the region
    for key, value in filenames.iteritems():
        zipname = str(key)+".zip" #str(key) contains the name of the region
        with zipfile.ZipFile(zipname, "w") as code:
            for url in filenames[key]:
                f = urllib2.urlopen(url)
                data = f.read()
                xmlfilename = url.rsplit('/', 1)[-1]
                code.writestr(xmlfilename, data)
    {% endhighlight %}               
                
Once we have the zip folders, we need to extract all the files in a folder with the same name as the zip folder. A quick manipulation of the *Regions_and_files.csv* file will reveal how many businesses are subjected to the standards in each part of the UK:


    #Create dataframe with recap data and bar plot
    import pandas
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    
    df = pandas.read_csv("Regions_and_files.csv")
    df.groupby('Region')['Businesses'].sum()
    df2 = pandas.Series.to_frame(df.groupby('Region')['Businesses'].sum())
    ax = df2.plot(kind='bar',title='Number of Businesses per Region in the UK, 2017',zorder=3)
    ax.grid(zorder=0,linestyle='--',linewidth=0.5) 
    plt.xticks(fontsize=8)  
    plt.tight_layout()

**Figure 1** 

Surprisingly, [Greater London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_London) is not the one with the highest number of businesses. These are instead located in the [South East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_East_England#Demographics) (67,401 different places scattered across cities such as Southampton, Oxford, Portsmouth, Canterbury, and many others). London comes next at 64,897. The least represented region is Northern Ireland, with 16,135 businesses.

Each file in the Scotland folder [has the hygiene descriptor under the *RatingValue* tag](http://ratings.food.gov.uk/OpenDataFiles/FHRS760en-GB.xml), whereas the files for the rest of the UK [have the hygiene score under the *Hygiene* tag](http://ratings.food.gov.uk/OpenDataFiles/FHRS250en-GB.xml). So, we need to loop through each file and get hold of these values.

### Plotting data

Now it's time to plot the data acquired from the xml files. The geographer's soul that's in me calls for them to be put on a nice map. Instead of using the inaccurate Python package [Basemap](https://matplotlib.org/basemap/users/examples.html), I want to load and display some [shapefiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile), because they allow me to select the appropriate administrative boundaries to show. Since this is a separate analysis, there are two dedicated shapefiles: <a href="/Files/Scotland.zip" target="_blank">one for Scotland</a> and <a href="/Files/UK_except_Scotland.zip" target="_blank">one for the rest of the UK</a>.

Drawing inspiration [from this blog post](http://brandonrose.org/pythonmap#Loading-in-the-shapefile), we can now plot a [cloropleth map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choropleth_map) showing the areas of the UK and Scotland where food hygiene ratings are poorest. The definition of "poor" for the purpose of this analysis is in both cases the percentage of non-complaint businesses with respect to the total:
