While sitting at the table of a restaurant, I have seen a fair number of people being utterly disgusted by the sight of a dirty fork, a greased knife, or a glass (unexpectedly) embellished by lipstick stains. [Bill Bryson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Bryson) would be glad to know that sometimes all of these had devilishly gathered *at the same table*. The reaction is always the same, because in one way or another, we are all concerned with hygiene when we visit a restaurant, a hotel, a pub, or any other place (especially if we have to pay).

In the United Kingdom, as well as in most Countries, this matter is taken seriously by the Government. In 2001, following the proposal of a [detailed report](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/265718/fsa.pdf), the [Food Standards Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_Standards_Agency) was formed, the purpose being to screen all businesses that serve food. The idea was to make sure they complied with a set of hygiene standards, so that food remains always safe to eat.

These standards, as well as the agency enforcing them, vary. In Scotland, food hygiene standards are overseen by [Food Standards Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_Standards_Scotland), while in the rest of the United Kingdom they are enforced by the [Food Standards Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_Standards_Agency).

As of May 2017, there are 47,477 businesses to be screened in Scotland, and
