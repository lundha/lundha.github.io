While sitting at the table of a restaurants, I have seen many people being utterly disgusted by the sight of a dirty fork, a greased knife, or a glass (unexpectedly) embellished by lipstick stains. [Bill Bryson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Bryson) would be happy to know that sometimes all of these had devilishly gathered *at the same table*. The reaction is always the same, because in one way or another, we are all concerned with hygiene when we visit a restaurant, a hotel, a pub, or any other place we visit, especially if we are expected to pay.

In the United Kingdom, as well as in most Countries, this matter is taken seriously by the Government. Thanks to a [detailed report](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/265718/fsa.pdf), the [Food Standards Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_Standards_Agency) was formed in 2001, the purpose being to screen all businesses that served food. The idea was to make sure they complied with a set of hygiene standards.
