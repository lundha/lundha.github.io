## Get data

### 3 options to retrieve the data

#### 1. Use beautfulSoup/Selenium 

Was not chosen as it seems like has made the class names dynamic, thus its become harder
to scrape the twitter infinite feed using Selenium.

#### 2. Find data set online

Found a data set at https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/harvard with relevant tweets from a 1 year period.
The downside is that the date set is not up-to-date.

{% highlight python3 %}

with open('/Users/Documents/web-bot/data/realdonaldtrump.ndjson') as f:
    data = ndjson.load(f)

outJson = open('/Users/Documents/web-bot/data/realdonaldtrump-text.json','w')

for d in data:
    outJson.write(d["text"])
    outJson.write("\n")

{% endhighlight %}

After extracting the relevant tweet text from the meta data, a clean up of the text is needed.

 * Remove @tags 
 * Remove https://links
 * Punctuations etc.
 * Remove retweets

#### 3. Use the designated Twitter API
 
 Option 3 is definitely the easiest. By developing an account at Twitter and use their API, relevant and up-to-date tweets are retrieved more easily.
